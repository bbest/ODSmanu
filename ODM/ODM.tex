\section{Introduction}\label{intro}}

As implemented so far, integrated ecosystem assessments are more often
than not bespoke products that are specific to regional policy needs at
varying spatial scales. While unique, these assessments are typically
built around the flow of the IEA framework outlined in (Levin et al.
2009). This process consists of a scoping step to outline management
objectives, the identification of ecosystem indicators to monitor key
processes, the compilation of ecosystem status reports highlighting
status and trends of indicators, a risk assessment step identifying
where ecosystem considerations might threaten management objectives, and
finally management strategy evaluation, in which potential management
actions are tested using simulation models. The elements of the IEA
framework are central to its implementation, but its flow is not
prescriptive. Instead, the IEA process is malleable to the needs of
stakeholders, meaning that IEAs may manifest in many different forms.

However, data acquisition, management, communication, and dissemination
are universal challenges that apply across the disparate applications of
IEAs. Solving these challenges is not trivial, but over the past decade
several examples have emerged suggesting the use of open data science
tools as potential solutions (Rocchini and Neteler 2012; Lowndes et al.
2015; Lowndes et al. 2017; Ma et al. 2018). For example, Lowndes et
al.~2017 discussed how embracing open science methods allowed for
increased efficiency, transparency, and reproducibility in the
development of the Ocean Health Index; a modular framework developed to
assess the benefits of marine ecosystems to humans for sustainable
management. Case studies for applying open science processes to IEAs
have also been developed for ecosystem reporting in the Northeast Large
Marine Ecosystem. Specifically, Ma et al.~2017 show how machine-readable
provenance may be incorporated into automated analytical workflows using
IPython and the Semantic Web.

Embracing these tools and strategies speaks to a broader philosophy of
open science that has yet to fully catch on in the IEA community. Beyond
making data publicly available, open science advocates for the ``free
and unfettered access to all aspects of the scientific endeavor''
(Hampton et al. 2015), including methods, data and scientific products.
These values lend themselves to the broad applicability of IEAs as
decision-making tools for ecosystem-based management (EBM).

There are several entry and exit points for data, methodological, and
scientific products throughout the execution of an IEA. Data entry
points are formed during the exploratory phases of the IEA process,
where objectives are scoped and representative indicators are developed.
Exit points for data products can be found in the derived indicator data
informing ecosystem status reports and risk assessments. Simulated
products and model parameters, such as those resulting from MSE model
runs, are also important to disseminate. Any data that leaves or enters
an IEA brings with it metadata and code used to analyze, process, and
visualize the data (in various stages of completion). Through the
process these datasets, accompanying code, and metadata documentation
become their own general, scientific and technical products feeding into
subsequent products and adding transparency and efficiency (Fig.
@ref(fig:iealoop)).

Without an underlying data management protocol, the vast quantities of
data and documentation required to successfully execute an IEA can be
overwhelming for practitioners and clients both. For example, the
development of ecosystem status reports and risk assessments requires
considering the management relevance of hundreds of data sets from many
fields. In practice this meant sifting through over 400 unique spatial
and temporal data sets that were submitted for consideration during the
development of the New England State of the Ecosystem Report, an IEA
product. However, only indicators of interest to managers and those
necessary for storytelling were included in the final product; just over
90 (Gaichas, Sarah and Hardison, Sean and Large, Scott and Lucey, Sean
2019). Depending on the governing body implementing the IEA, each data
set must be fully documented with metadata and made publicly available.
Versioning data sets and associated metadata relative to specific IEA
products also introduces challenges for scientists operating outside the
bounds of their training. These hurdles result in data processing and
documentation becoming a full time job, and indeed, it is becoming
increasingly common for IEA teams to hire Data Analysts and Data
Scientists to deal with the data deluge.

The implementation of IEA is an amalgam of the ecosystem and data
sciences. Understanding this, we suggest that IEA teams embrace a
philosophy of open science. This approach has gained momentum over the
past decade within the ecological sciences as a way to deal with large
amounts of data produced from a variety of sources (Michener and Jones
2012), as well as to improve transparency, reproducibility,
repeatability, and ease of communication of data products (Rocchini and
Neteler 2012; Lowndes et al. 2015; Lowndes et al. 2017; Ma et al. 2018).
This can be accomplished using openly available tools, many of which are
highlighted by Hampton et al. (2015) and Lowndes et al. (2017).

The benefits of implementing software development strategies range from
the ethical to the practical. For example, Lowndes et al. (2017)
suggests that changing ecosystem conditions due to anthropogenic impacts
necessitate openness among environmental scientists whose data (and code
to recreate their data) provide ``snapshots'' of their study systems
amidst the changes. Further, openly-sourcing scientific data with
accompanying code provides a record from which previous results may be
built upon as more data are collected (Lowndes et al. 2017). From this
perspective, iterative IEA products such as ecosystem reports and risk
assessments are themselves data points; forming ever-extending arrays of
compiled information through time. This approach has been embraced by
the Ocean Health Index, which is designed to monitor human-ocean
relationships through time by repeated compilation and analysis of
ecosystem data (Halpern et al. 2012; Halpern et al. 2015; Lowndes et al.
2015).

We suggest that the incorporation of version control and standardized
methods for the collection, aggregation, and dissemination of
IEA-oriented data and products can facilitate flexible and efficient use
of IEAs, broadening their applicability and hastening their uptake by
resource managers. These methods also confront the challenging spatial
aspects of IEAs, which are inherently unique to the systems being
addressed. As we discuss below, embracing standardized methods and open
data science principles/tools would facilitate the implementation of
future IEAs in new systems.
